SecurityCraft WTHIT Addon
=============

This is an addon mod for the Minecraft mod [SecurityCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/security-craft), adding integration with [WTHIT](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wthit-forge). While this is part of the main mod in newer Minecraft versions, technical limitations mean that this isn't the case in SecurityCraft for Minecraft 1.18.2 and 1.16.5. This mod fills that gap and adds WTHIT integration to SecurityCraft in those versions.
